LIMITATIONS & WISHLIST 

Important note on Chinese support-

It turns out that a new browser has entered the market that I was unware of, courtesy of Alibaba’s Jack Ma. UC Browser has 5% worldwide market share and 15% of the mobile phone market in China, (appears to be dropping recently).

This current version of the multilingual library doesn’t work with it. There are other major limitations, like a lack of CSS grid support, so hopefully UC Browser will either catch up soon, or fall into obscurity.

With this, my current improvements wishlist for the webflow-multilingual library is-

+ Support for SUBMIT button text
+ Support for INPUT placeholder text
+ Support for UC Browser (Chinese)


HOW TO USE
